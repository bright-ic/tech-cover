              The release of the first iPhone in 2007 caused a major disruption in the mobile phone industry, 
              making for a gold rush that is reminiscent of the wild west and whose effects are still 
              resonating today, 10 years later, across multiple industries.
              If you wish to build a globally-recognized mobile application nowadays, you want to have it available for 
              both Android and iOS. You can (and arguably should) launch it on one of the two platforms, but when and if 
              you get traction users will start approaching you asking for the app to be available for their platform. 
              This approach serves as a wake-up call that you’re missing out on 30%-70% of smartphone owners as potential 
              users (depending on your demographic).
              Around a year ago, we began evaluating React Native as a means to build a cross-platform mobile application. 
              The development of Snipe for mobile incepted at Q2 of 2018, and so far has been based around React Native 
              exclusively. This includes: realizing the product vision, building an MVP, releasing it on the App Store
              and Play Store, and building it up through regular software updates.

                React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering
                 mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript 
                 library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets
                  mobile platforms.
              </q>

              The initial idea behind the Snipe App was to help gamers find good teammates to play
               with — a problem that is widespread throughout the world of competitive gaming and Esports — 
               by revolutionizing the way they do so. No more would gamers need to rely on their luck when 
               seeking teammates by using in-game matchmaking (where the focus lies on creating fair matches 
               between two opposing groups), spamming Discord servers, or going through forum-based Websites. 
               The alternative we were to offer is matchmaking for teammates, powered by AI (utilizing ML 
               models and recommender systems technology) on the server, and a mobile application for 
               the client,
                so that users can find people to play with later, throughout their day.
                We’ve assembled a technical team of varied backgrounds, even so, it just so happens that our 
                combined 
                experience 
                in developing mobile apps, at that point, added up to a couple of “Hello World”-esque Android 
                apps. This, plus the desire to release both on iOS and Android, has made the promise of React 
                Native very appealing to us.
                React Native is a Facebook maintained open source toolset (MIT-licensed) that enables 
                building cross-platform mobile apps (on iOS and Android) in JavaScript (making use of
                JavaScriptCore, WebKit’s JavaScript engine), based on React with web-like styling and 
                markup syntaxes similar to CSS and HTML. It has been around since 2015 and is being used 
                by the likes of Airbnb, Wix, and Discord, making it arguably the most mature and widely 
                used of the cross-platform apps development solutions (other similar solutions that come 
                to mind: Native Script, Apache Cordova, Microsoft Xamarin, and the newly released Google Flutter).
                As we’ve soon discovered, building cross-platforms React Native apps from scratch does 
                not come without its obstacles, ones that developers doing typical mobile app development
                seldom need to face.
                The rest of this post will focus on our development experience with React Native — what we
                like, what we don’t, and when we recommend using it. It should be noted that we are using
                  React Native v55 (which is fairly recent but is not the newest).

              The release of the first iPhone in 2007 caused a major disruption in the mobile phone industry, 
              making for a gold rush that is reminiscent of the wild west and whose effects are still 
              resonating today, 10 years later, across multiple industries.
              If you wish to build a globally-recognized mobile application nowadays, you want to have it available for 
              both Android and iOS. You can (and arguably should) launch it on one of the two platforms, but when and if 
              you get traction users will start approaching you asking for the app to be available for their platform. 
              This approach serves as a wake-up call that you’re missing out on 30%-70% of smartphone owners as potential 
              users (depending on your demographic).
              Around a year ago, we began evaluating React Native as a means to build a cross-platform mobile application. 
              The development of Snipe for mobile incepted at Q2 of 2018, and so far has been based around React Native 
              exclusively. This includes: realizing the product vision, building an MVP, releasing it on the App Store
              and Play Store, and building it up through regular software updates.

                React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering
                 mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript 
                 library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets
                  mobile platforms.

              The initial idea behind the Snipe App was to help gamers find good teammates to play
               with
               <p class="italics"> — a problem that is widespread throughout the world of competitive gaming and Esports </p>
               — by revolutionizing the way they do so. No more would gamers need to rely on their luck when 
               seeking teammates by using in-game matchmaking (where the focus lies on creating fair matches 
               between two opposing groups), spamming Discord servers, or going through forum-based Websites. 
               The alternative we were to offer is matchmaking for teammates, powered by AI (utilizing ML 
               models and recommender systems technology) on the server, and a mobile application for 
               the client,
                so that users can find people to play with later, throughout their day.
                We’ve assembled a technical team of varied backgrounds, even so, it just so happens that our 
                combined 
                experience 
                in developing mobile apps, at that point, added up to a couple of “Hello World”-esque Android 
                apps. This, plus the desire to release both on iOS and Android, has made the promise of React 
                Native very appealing to us.

            <p>
              React Native is a Facebook maintained open source toolset (MIT-licensed) that enables 
              building cross-platform mobile apps (on iOS and Android) in JavaScript (making use of
              JavaScriptCore, WebKit’s JavaScript engine), based on React with web-like styling and 
              markup syntaxes similar to CSS and HTML. It has been around since 2015 and is being used 
              by the likes of Airbnb, Wix, and Discord, making it arguably the most mature and widely 
              used of the cross-platform apps development solutions (other similar solutions that come 
              to mind: <span class="underline">Native Script, Apache Cordova, Microsoft Xamarin, and the newly released Google Flutter</span>).
              As we’ve soon discovered, building cross-platforms React Native apps from scratch does 
              not come without its obstacles, ones that developers doing typical mobile app development
              seldom need to face.
              The rest of this post will focus on our development experience with React Native — what we
              like, what we don’t, and when we recommend using it. It should be noted that we are using
                React Native v55 (which is fairly recent but is not the newest).
            </p>
            <p class="underline bold">What We Like ABout React Native</p>
            <p>
              The fact that React Native actually renders using its host platform’s standard 
              rendering APIs enables it to stand out from most existing methods of cross-platform
               application development, like Cordova or Ionic. Existing methods of writing mobile 
               applications using combinations of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS typically render using webviews. 
               While this approach can work, it also comes with drawbacks, especially around performance.
                Additionally, they do not usually have access to the host platform’s set of native UI 
                elements. When these frameworks do try to mimic native UI elements, the results usually 
                “feel” just a little off; reverse-engineering all the fine details of things like animations 
                takes an enormous amount of effort, and they can quickly become out of date.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, React Native actually translates your markup to real, native UI elements, 
              leveraging existing means of rendering views on whatever platform you are working with. 
              Additionally, React works separately from the main UI thread, so your application can 
              maintain high performance without sacrificing capability. The update cycle in React Native 
              is the same as in React: when props or state change, React Native re-renders the views. 
              The major difference between React Native and React in the browser is that React Native
               does this by leveraging the UI libraries of its host platform, rather than using HTML 
               and CSS markup.
            </p>
            <p>
              For developers accustomed to working on the Web with React, this means you can write
               mobile apps with the performance and look and feel of a native application, while using 
               familiar tools. React Native also represents an improvement over normal mobile development
              in two other areas: the developer experience and cross-platform development potential.
